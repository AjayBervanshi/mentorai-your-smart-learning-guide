## 2024-05-18 - [Avoid any micro optimizations unless they are measurable]
**Learning:** Micro optimizations are generally not worth it without metrics. Focus on caching and avoiding O(N^2) instead of micro things like variable swapping.
**Action:** Always measure.

## 2026-04-08 - [Batch Independent Supabase Queries]
**Learning:** Sequential Supabase queries during initial data loading (`loadUserData`) create a network waterfall, significantly delaying the application load time. This is a common performance bottleneck in architectures relying heavily on client-side Supabase calls.
**Action:** Always batch independent Supabase queries using `Promise.all()` to fetch data concurrently, reducing overall latency.
## 2024-06-11 - Batch Supabase Queries & Derive State Locally
**Learning:** Making independent sequential Supabase `.from()` queries causes noticeable network waterfalls, especially when reading from multiple related tables on component mount, or updating multiple tables upon user interaction.
**Action:** When executing independent database requests in Supabase, parallelize them by wrapping them in `Promise.all()`. Additionally, derive intermediate states locally from the global React Context rather than running redundant `SELECT` queries right before an `UPDATE`, to avoid unnecessary roundtrips.
## 2024-05-18 - [Optimizing chained array passes]
**Learning:** Consolidating sequential `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` chains into a single `for...of` pass reduces time complexity constant factors, but you must be careful to match the original type inference, such as using `undefined` instead of `null` when replacing `.find()`, to avoid breaking strict TypeScript expectations downstream.
**Action:** When converting array iterators to loops for performance, explicitly declare the loop variables with the exact same types that the original array methods returned.
## 2026-05-07 - Memoize Expensive Array Computations in Components with Rapid Local State
**Learning:** Components containing both rapid local state updates (like text inputs for "Add Skill") and expensive array derivations (like looping over all skills and topics) can suffer from performance degradation, as the expensive O(N*M) loop re-runs on every keystroke. Using hooks like `useMemo` below an early return breaks React's Rules of Hooks.
**Action:** When introducing `useMemo` to optimize derived state, carefully ensure it is placed *before* any early returns. Handle the potentially null or undefined state internally within the hook (e.g. by returning default fallback values) to satisfy the Rules of Hooks and prevent runtime crashes.
