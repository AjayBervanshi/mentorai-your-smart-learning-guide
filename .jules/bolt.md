## 2024-06-11 - Batch Supabase Queries & Derive State Locally
**Learning:** Making independent sequential Supabase `.from()` queries causes noticeable network waterfalls, especially when reading from multiple related tables on component mount, or updating multiple tables upon user interaction.
**Action:** When executing independent database requests in Supabase, parallelize them by wrapping them in `Promise.all()`. Additionally, derive intermediate states locally from the global React Context rather than running redundant `SELECT` queries right before an `UPDATE`, to avoid unnecessary roundtrips.
## 2024-05-18 - [Optimizing chained array passes]
**Learning:** Consolidating sequential `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` chains into a single `for...of` pass reduces time complexity constant factors, but you must be careful to match the original type inference, such as using `undefined` instead of `null` when replacing `.find()`, to avoid breaking strict TypeScript expectations downstream.
**Action:** When converting array iterators to loops for performance, explicitly declare the loop variables with the exact same types that the original array methods returned.
